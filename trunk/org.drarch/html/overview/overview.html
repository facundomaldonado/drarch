<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>To represent the architectural views, we provide two graphical notations:
 component diagrams and UCM diagrams. Basically, the component diagrams are used 
 to represent structural aspects of the architecture being modeled, while the UCM 
 diagrams are used to capture different behaviors of this architecture. 
 This Eclipse plugin can be used to understand an existing software system when 
 there is little or no architecture documentation available.</p>
<P>JQuery is a query-based source code browser plug-in for Eclipse. 
It allows you to run a lot of flexible queries. There are many pre-written 
queries that can be run as-is or modified to suit a specific purpose.</P>
<P>
The query engine used in JQuery is a logic programming engine, implemented 
in Java, called TyRuBa. The syntax of TyRuBa is similar to that of Prolog, 
a popular logic programming language. A set of TyRuBa predicates and rules 
have been defined that make up the JQuery query language. 
These predicates operate on a fact database that is generated from walking 
the Eclipse JDT abstract syntax tree (for .java files) and parsing java 
bytecode (for .class files). JQuery uses the ASM bytecode manipulation 
framework for parsing .class files.</P> 
<p>
We provide a set of additional predicate that aids to generate queries 
that contains information about the architectural representation.
