<h1>DRArch - Discover and Recover Architecture</h1>
Architecture Reconstruction is the process of recovers and 
discovers the architecture of a software system. First, the 
information from an implemented system is extracted. Then build 
abstractions of that information, through the use of a query
 language and generating architecture views of that information.
  To extract information about the source code, we use a JQuery plugin.
