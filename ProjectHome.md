# Overview #
Architecture Reconstruction is a process in which the "as-built" architecture of an implemented system is obtained from an existing system. This is done through a detailed analysis of the system using tool support. The tool (**DRArch**) extract information about the system and aid in building and aggregating successive levels of abstraction. The end result is an architectural representation.

The result of architectural reconstruction can be used in several ways. If no documentation exists or if it is out of date, the recovered architectural representation can be used as a basis for re-documenting the architecture. The results of a reconstruction can also be used  to recover the as built architecture to check conformance against an "as-designed" architecture. This assures us that the developers have followed the architectural edicts. The reconstruction can also be used as the basis for analyzing the architecture or as a starting point for re-engineering the system to a new desired architecture. Finally, the representation can be used to identify elements for re-use or to establish an architecture-based software product line.


**DRArch** define a process of Software Architecture Reconstruction. Consists of a collection of tools that can be used to extract information from an implemented system, build abstractions of that information, through the use of a query language and generate architecture views of that information.

The following diagram show the main concept of **DRArch**:
